## From the Developer:

This is a Self Project, made on MERN Stack. After going through basics of MERN I needed some kind of full project to work on and gather some experience on Full Stack MERN Development on my own. So I decided to make a Contact App.

This is a Full Stack Web App just like Google Contacts, where users can Sign Up, and Create and Store their contacts.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to leave the suggestions. Constructive Criticism is always appreciated.

NOTE: This is a demo project. There can be a lot of more features and functionalities that could be added with this.
